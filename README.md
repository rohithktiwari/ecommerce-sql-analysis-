# 📊 Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis  

## 🎯 Objective  
Use SQL queries to **extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data** from an E-commerce database.  
This project demonstrates real-world SQL skills including filtering, joins, aggregations, subqueries, views, and optimization with indexes.  

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite  
- SQL Workbench / pgAdmin / or any SQL client  

---

## 📂 Dataset  
**Ecommerce_SQL_Database** (includes tables: `Users`, `Campaigns`, `Ads`, `Ad_Events`)  

---

## ✨ Key Queries & Learnings  

### 🔎 Querying & Filtering  
- Campaigns ended in year `2025`  
- Users from Japan aged `25-40`  
- Ad events that occurred on **Monday Evening**  

### 🔗 Joins & Relationships  
- Campaigns with ad platforms  
- Users who interacted via `Click` events  
- Campaigns targeting `18-24` + `fashion` interest  

### 📊 Aggregations & Grouping  
- Count of events per day  
- Average age of users per country  
- Total budget for campaigns targeting `Impression`  

### 🧩 Subqueries & Views  
- View: `show_target_interests_ad_platforms`  
- Users interacting with more than `3 ads`  
- Platform with highest `Share` events  

### ⚡ Optimization  
- Indexing on `user_age` & `total_budget`
